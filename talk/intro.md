# What Is WebAssembly?

Assembly instruction that run on the web.
Low-level bytecode







## Traditional path

C code -> compiler -> Assembly
C++    -> compiler -> Assembly
Rust   -> compiler -> Assembly







## Web assembly path

C code -> compiler -> WebAssembly
C++    -> compiler -> WebAssembly
Rust   -> compiler -> WebAssembly







## Benefits

* Fast code without the tricks.
* Take your language to the web.
* The web as a compile target.








## Status

* Runs on all evergreen browsers: https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm
* Many of the "nice things" have landed
* The community will build more - https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs
* `debugger` statements, TBD
